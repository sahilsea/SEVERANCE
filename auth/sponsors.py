"""Compartment ownership, sponsor authority, and delegation engine.

NON-NEGOTIABLE DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
1. Two separate powers, two separate roles:
   - Admins provision accounts and set hierarchical pay grades.
   - Compartment Sponsors own compartments and decide who may enter them.
   - An admin CANNOT grant any compartment, ever.
2. Ownership is declared in config/compartments.json, checked in and signed off once.
3. Only a compartment's sponsor (or authorized delegate) may grant/revoke that compartment.
4. Owning one compartment gives ZERO authority over other compartments.
5. NOBODY can grant compartments to themselves.
6. Every grant/revoke action writes an immutable audit ledger entry.
7. Startup check: If config/compartments.json names a sponsor whose account does not exist,
   fail loudly with a specific error identifying the missing sponsor.
