"""Persistent per-person conversation history: titles + question/answer turns.

Unlike the audit ledger (append-only, hash-chained, readable by every
authenticated user as a shared transparency log) and report_data (full-
fidelity answer storage keyed by ledger row, read back only through the
ownership-checked /report/{id} endpoint), this table exists purely so a
person can see and resume their OWN past conversations across logins -- a UI
convenience, like Claude's chat history sidebar. Every read and write here is
scoped to person_id; nothing here is shared between users, and every read
re-checks ownership before returning anything.

This also supplies the short "recent turns" context fed into intent
classification and drafting (see harness/runner.py) -- now correctly scoped
per-conversation instead of a global per-person window, and durable instead
of in-memory.
