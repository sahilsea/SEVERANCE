"""Unit tests for auth/sponsors.py.

Verifies:
1. An admin CANNOT grant a compartment.
2. A sponsor CANNOT grant a compartment they do not own.
3. Nobody can grant a compartment to themselves.
4. A valid sponsor grant succeeds and writes an immutable ledger entry.
5. Missing sponsor account declared in config fails loudly at startup.
